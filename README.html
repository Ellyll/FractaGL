        This is a real time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot</a> generator using WebGL.
        You can click to drag it around, use the mousewheel to zoom in and out and even go full screen. On touch devices you can use your fingers and pinch to zoom in and out.

        It should work in most modern browsers and in many modern phones, but I've only tested it on Firefox 26 on
        Ubuntu 12.04LTS and on the latest (January 2014) Chrome and Firefox on a Nexus 4 so far. I also tested it on an old HTC Desire Z, but
        it didn't work on that.
